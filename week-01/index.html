          - Things like, visitors can sign up, users can add books
          - Write out workflows, steps needed to complete a task
        3. Architecture site structure
          - Main navigation
        4. Take it one feature at a time.

          - you typically have a local and remote repo
        - __Commit__ is a snapshot of your code at a given time
        - __Branch__ is single timeline of your codes changes
          - every repo has a _master_ branch

        # Git commands

        ### Things unique to GitHub

        - __Pull Requests__ is a method for merging two remote branches together directly from GitHub.
        - __Issues__ allows us to add comment threads to communicate with other users on whats happening in the code
