        ## Git at 10,000 feet

        - __Repository__ is the place where code is stored
          - you typically have a local and remote repo
        - __Commit__ is a snapshot of your code at a given time
        - __Branch__ is single timeline of your codes changes
          - every repo has a _master_ branch

        - __Clone__ - copy a repo, typically to a local machine
        - __Remote__ - is a repo located somewhere besides local
          - GitHub is a host which allows your to restore remote repositories
        - __Add/Remove__ - add or remove files to the list of filings tracked by git
        - __Checkout__ - is the act of changing to a particular branch
        - __Push__ - copy git commits from a local repository to a remote
        - __Pull__ - copy git commits from a remote repository to a local
        - __Merge__ - apply changes from one branch into another

        We will be using GitHub for storing our work. Its a web service that lets us collaborate with other developers. They provide a clean UI for us to view and mange our remote  git repositories

        ### Things unique to GitHub

        - __Pull Requests__ is a method for merging two remote branches together directly from GitHub.
        - __Fork__ allows you to clone someone elses repo and have a completely separate version for you to work on.
        - __Issues__ allows us to add comment threads to communicate with other users on whats happening in the code

        # Lets level up!

        Once your box is created, you should be able to open the IDE. This provides you with both a web-based code editor and a console/terminal for you to interact with. Each box has a "/workspace" directory where you will want to put all your code into. Lets do that

        ```sh
        $ cd workspace
        $ mkdir hello_world
        $ cd hello_world
        $ touch hello.rb

        ## Lets write some ruby

        - Go into your workspace/hello_world directory in your IDE and open `hello.rb`
        - type the following

        ```ruby 
        #!/user/bin/env ruby

        puts "Hello World!"
        ```

        - Save it! (File>Save or CMD+s)
        - Go into the console and type

        ```sh
        $ ruby hello.rb
        #=> Hello World!

        $ git commit -m "my first commit!"

        ## Uh-Oh!

        Looks like it barked at your for not setting some git config info. No biggie. Type the following replacing "Your Name" with yours and the email address "you@example.com" with the one you used to sign up to github

        ```sh
        $ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
        $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"    
        ```

        Git keeps track of when and who added commits to a repo, so it wants to know this info before it lets you commit. Go ahead and try committing again.

        ## Lets get it to GitHub
        So great, we have our local repo cookin. Lets push it on up to github. We need to do some prep work. Communicating with remote repos requires it to know who its talking to so not just anyone can commit code to it. It uses what are called SSH keys to do this.

        1. In nitrous, CMD+click the "Boxes" Link in the top left
        2. Find your box and click it.
        3. You should see a link "Reveal Public Key", click it
        4. Once it pops up, you can click the green scissor icon to copy your box ssh keys
        1. Now, go into GitHub and sign in. 
        2. On the top right, there is a tool-like icon for account settings, click it.
        3. Find the "SSH Keys" tab on the left sidebar nav, click it.
        4. Find the "Add SSH keys" button in the middle of the page
        5. Give these keys a title so you know what they are for
        6. Then paste your keys into the Key field.
        7. Click "Add Key"

        # Create a repo on GitHub
        Okay, cool, now we have settled.

        1. On the top right of github there is a plus icon. Click it
        2. Choose "New repository"
        3. In repository name, enter "hello-world"
        4. Dont worry about the other options.
        5. Hit "Create repository", This will take you to your new repo
        6. Find the URL field that has a url like `git@github.com:yourusername/hello-world.git`
        7. Hit the clipboard icon next to it to copy this url

        <script type="text/template">
        ## Push to Github

        - In your IDE, go to the console and type the following, replace the url with the one you copied:

        ```sh
        $ git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/hello-world.git
        $ git push -u origin master
        ```

        - It will ask if you want to continue, type "yes"
        - If you pop back into GitHub, you should now see your code!

        ## Lets clone
        So if you want to start jammin on existing code, how do you do it? Well if it's someone elses repo, its as easy as cloning on github and then cloning it down to your nitrous box.

        1. Go to https://github.com/mttdffy/wbdv465-hello
        2. At the top right, you'll see a "Fork" button, click it
        3. It will clone my repo to your account.
        4. Once there, you can find the "clone URl" on the bottom of the right sidebar
        5. Copy the url that looks like the one we copied earlier.
        6. Go into nitrous and do the following

        ```sh
        $ cd ../hello-world
        $ git clone git@github.com:yourusername/wbdv465-hello.git
        $ cd wvdv465-hello
        $ ruby example.rb
        ```
        </script>
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        <script type="text/template">
        ## NICE!
        you should now have a copy of this code locally that outputs my name 3 times.

        Lets make it your own.

        - In the Nitrous IDE, open the example.rb
        - Find the like that sets name equal to mine and change it to yours
        - Save the file and run the ruby command again in the console
        - It should now output your name 3 times
        </script>
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        <script type="text/template">
        ## Lets commit this change and push it up to github

        ```sh
        $ git add example.rb
        $ git commit -m "making it my own!"
        $ git push origin master
        ```

        Since theres already a git repo, theres no need to `init` or add a remote. We can simply stage the change we made and push it to github. If you go to your repo on github, you should be able to see the change. MONEY.
