# Advance Web Applications with Ruby on Rails

The goal of this class is to introduce students to advanced concepts of building web applications using Ruby on Rails. Students will learn the importance of maintainable application architecture through MVC and CRUD design patterns. Git, a version control system, will be utilized to demonstrate the value of code history, while using it to track each student’s progress.

Students will work throughout the term to build a web application from inception to deployment. The midterm will be a challenge to build a small application based on instructor-provided features and specifications in just two weeks. 

The final will require students to complete the application they proposed early in the term.

In class, the students will follow along as the instructor builds an application in class throughout the term, explaining concepts and adding complexity each week.

## Attendance Policy

[Attendance is mandatory](http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policyweb/absence.html). Students are expected to attend all classes and strictly adhere to the project due dates. Lack of participation in class discussions will count against your grade.

Students are allowed one unexcused absence.

__If a student has more than one unexcused absence, his or her grade for the course will be reduced one letter grade.
If a student has three absences, he or she will receive an F grade.__

Note that an excused absence is defined as one that is the result of a condition or circumstance beyond the student’s control, such as illness, a family crisis or emergency, or some other serious and important personal circumstance. An absence will be excused only if there is documentation verifying the circumstances that caused the absence.

**Arriving late to class will result in the loss of one point for each lateness.**
