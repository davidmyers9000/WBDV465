# Advance Web Applications with Ruby on Rails

The goal of this class is to introduce students to advanced concepts of building web applications using Ruby on Rails. Students will learn the importance of maintainable application architecture through MVC and CRUD design patterns. Git, a version control system, will be utilized to demonstrate the value of code history, while using it to track each studentâ€™s progress.

Students will work throughout the term to build a web application from inception to deployment. The midterm will be a challenge to build a small application based on instructor-provided features and specifications in just two weeks. 

The final will require students to complete the application they proposed early in the term.

In class, the students will follow along as the instructor builds an application in class throughout the term, explaining concepts and adding complexity each week.
